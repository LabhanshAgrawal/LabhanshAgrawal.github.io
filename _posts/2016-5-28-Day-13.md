## Setting up Distributed-Frontera

I am setting up Distributed-frontera on my machine to try it out and writing Dockerfiles for it simultaneously.  
* [Distributed Frontera tutorial](https://github.com/scrapinghub/frontera/blob/distributed/docs/source/topics/distributed-architecture.rst)  
* [Distributed Frontera Docs](http://distributed-frontera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)  

### Scrapy

* Install Scrapy on Ubuntu using

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
$ pip install Scrapy
```

* For other Operating systems refer to the [Installation guide](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html).

I couldn't find a good Docker image for scrapy so I will be writing one on my own.

### Setting up Kafka locally

* Follow the [Kafka Tutorial](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart) till step 6.  
* At step 2

```bash
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```

This gave me an error about permission being denied. So I tried changing the owner of the folder using

```bash
$ sudo chown -R $USER: kafka_2.11-0.10.0.0
```

But the downloaded files were on another partition which is automatically mounted on login by root. Hence I placed it in my home folder and voilaa!!

* We have now ensured that Kafka is running and got some feel as to how it works.  

As for the next step in Frontera setup I have HBase already setup.    
After this point I started Kafka on docker image to try the message producer and listener there.

### Using Kafka docker image


* Clone the Docker image GitHub repository using

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker.git
```

and open the directory  .

* Follow steps from the [Tutorial](http://wurstmeister.github.io/kafka-docker/) for running the image.
* Install docker-compose
* Install command completion for the bash

* Get docker host ip using

```bash
$ ip addr show dev docker0
```

* I'm stuck at the Kafka shell part as I'm unable to find the ZK_HOST.
