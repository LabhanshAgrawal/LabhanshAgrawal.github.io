* Read about Nutch at [Nutch Front Page](http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/FrontPage)  
* Started [Nutch 2.x Tutorial](http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/Nutch2Tutorial)  
* Followed [Nutch 1.x Tutorial](http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/NutchTutorial) upto seed lists  
* HBase 1.15 is released but I went for 0.98.19 since the latest version of Gora is tied to version 0.98.x of HBase and that works with Hadoop 2.7.x  
* Set up and configured HBase in Pseudo Distributed Mode from the docs bundled in the tar.gz  
* Set configurations from Nutch 1.x tutorial in 2.x  
* Followed the rest and started compilation by

```
ant runtime -verbose
```

* Compilation took 78 minutes!!
