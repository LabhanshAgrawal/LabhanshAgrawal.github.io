Setup Hadoop Single Node Cluster using  
1. [Hadoop: Setting up a Single Node Cluster.](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html)  
2. [How to configure Apache Hadoop in Standalone Mode](https://www.3pillarglobal.com/insights/how-to-configure-apache-hadoop-in-standalone-mode)  
3. [Running Hadoop on Ubuntu Linux (Single-Node Cluster)](http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-hadoop-on-ubuntu-linux-single-node-cluster)  

There is disparity between the 3 tutorials due to changes in latest hadoop directory structure and some commands are now deprecated and replaced with new ones.  
I installed oracle java as it had good stats on hadoop java page.  

From the three sources useful instructions are respectively  
1. Follow the pseudo-distributed guide, xml  
2. Use the IPv6 alternative method, Data directory setup, xml  
3. SSH configuration, xml
